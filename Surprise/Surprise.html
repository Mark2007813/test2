      <p>
        You and I first met each other for the very fisrt time, not knowing we
        would fall in love with each other. We made our first ever project,
        <b>together</b>. And the project was named <b>"Age of Exploration"</b>.
        It was also the time that we were exploring each other.

      <h2>
        Our first ever video call<hr>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I vividly remember that day. I wanted to show you how to make a paper
        boat. I even called it <b>"the cooler boat"</b> because it had a little roof. And
        after teaching you how to make the boat, we showed our faces for the very first time to each other.

      <p>
        We were talking at night and you were acting a little weird. So I told
        you to tell me but you didn't, saying that it had nothing to do with me.
        But somehow deep down, I knew it had something to do about me. So I kept
        asking you to tell me until you finally did. You said
        <b
          >"I like you. It's fine if you wanna be just friend, I'll just take it
          back"</b
        >. And I replied
        <b
          >"You know, I'm also interested in you. I like you. I somehow wanna
          see you smile; it kinda makes me happy"</b
        >.<br><br>We heard each other's feelings and talked for a while. I'm glad you told
        me that night and I can't imagine what would happened if you didn't.

      <p>
        The day we finally make it official. The day we started exploring each
        other really deep. The day that changed our destiny.

    <div class="fights">
      <h2>As a couple, we couldn't avoid fights too.</h2>
      <p>
        But after every fight, we both tried to fix what needed to be fixed. The
        biggest fight I know was the one during your vacation.
        <b>The day I really made you cry</b>. I'll never forget it and I'll
        never be able to forgive myself for that. But at the end of the day, we
        went through every obstacle, every problem and every challenges, <b>together</b>. Fights
        were also what made us close to each other. All those fights made us
        understand each other better than anyone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="memories">
      <h2>Fights weren't the only thing we had.</h2>
      <p>
        We shared laughs, joy and love. We fell in love during these memories,
        making our love stronger and more heartwarming
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="I-love-you">
      <h2>I love you...</h2>
      <p>
        There were a lot of memories that I didn't mention. But we both know
        what they are and they will always be in our hearts as memorable
        moments... <br />It's been 2 years already or at least almost 2 years.
        Time flies, right? Even after all these months and days and hours, I can
        feel that our love is only getting stronger. Every minute I spend with
        you is a reward and every smile you have is an achievement for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you honey. We both may not be perfect human beings, but those
        imperfections are what make us perfect for each other. You mean
        everything to me, honey. I love you infinity...
